Today january 5 2023 7:40 I will start my front end online course and use this README file to track my progress, my knowlodge is shallow and the journey ahead is longer than i can imagine making me wonder if I am capable if this small feat.
Today january 6 2023 7:33 I finished the first html part of my course its not a great achievemnt but its something that i should at least be happy about unfortunetely for me my greed grows larger and i am still unsitisfied.
Today january 7 2023 6:26 I am starting the first part of CSS studies and I am felling discouraged yet studying is not a matter of pleasure and discipline, so I will continue with my uneducated efforts of learning unsure if this is the right path or if I will be able to accomplish anything before the deadline that I set to myself.
Today january 10 2023 5:17 I started studying during the dusk due to sleeping during the afternoon the day before and right now I am half way through my CSS introduction course so I think I am progressing at a fine rate.
